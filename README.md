# Machine-Learning-Undergraduate-Course-CSE.UOI.GR

### This repository has two parts of exercises for the Machine Learning Undergraduate Course at CSE UOI for the year 2024-2025

- The objective of this first (1st) assignment was to develop a decision system that classifies facial images into two categories (binary classification). We explored and compared multiple classification methodologies, analyzed the impact of different approaches to handling image-based information.

- At the second part we explored different dimensionality reduction methods like PCA, LLE, and Autoencoders. We then used K-Means and Agglomerative Clustering and we computed Purity score, F-measure score Silhouette score. We estimated the optimal number of clusters (ùíå‚àó) based on the Silhouette index. More on this in the [pdf](WA2_M2025.pdf)
